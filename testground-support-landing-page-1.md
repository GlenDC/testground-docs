## **Testground Support**

**It’s great that you’ve decided to start using our Testground Environment for your testplans!  It is our wish that Testground is both intuitive and seamless for you to use, but we also know that sometimes getting started is the hardest part.**


**As such we’ve created a documentation repository that we hope will  help guide you through the process and answer any questions you might have as you go along.**


**Take a minute to familiarize yourself with some of the below topics to help make your Testground experience as easy as it can be.**


* **What is Testground?**
* **Prerequisites, installation and setup**
* **Concepts and architecture**
* **Writing test plans**
* **Building test plans**
* **Running test plans**
* **Collecting outputs**
* **Monitoring the execution environment**
* **Debugging**

**In the event that maybe we didn’t address your question or you’re still having some trouble, please remember that our work is never finished. If you see anything you think we can do better, please do not hesitate to file an issue or open a PR!**
